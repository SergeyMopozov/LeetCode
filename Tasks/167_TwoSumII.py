"""
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= first < second <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
